Weather App

This Weather App is a React-based project that provides real-time weather updates using a weather API. It features a modern and responsive design built with Material UI, allowing users to search for weather information by city name and view real-time temperature, humidity, and weather conditions. The app leverages Axios for API requests and ensures a seamless user experience on both mobile and desktop devices. With its simple yet effective UI, this project serves as a great demonstration of React, API integration, and responsive UI design principles.
